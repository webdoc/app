What is a webdoc app?

A webdoc app is an application that can be used by authors to help create webdocs. It appears in the sidebar to the right of a webdoc when in edit mode. A webdoc app can place and modify items in a webdoc, display content that can be dragged and dropped onto a webdoc, and request information about a webdoc and it's author.

The app is displayed inside an iframe, so you have full control over how your app looks an behaves.



How to make a webdoc app

1. Grab a copy of the repository at http://github.com/webdoc/app. It has everything you need to get started:

  - A script tag that loads the webdoc app API.
  - A blank icon.png.
  - A config.xml file.
  - Links to CSS and JS for creating apps that look and behave like webdoc's apps.

2. Make an icon and place it in the root directory of your app. The icon must be a PNG file with square dimensions. 64px x 64px would be a good choice.

3. Study the API and get coding.

4. Upload the app the webdoc.com.



How to upload your app to webdoc

1. Make sure you have an icon in your root directory.

2. Make sure that your config.xml file has your app's name, version and a reference to the index.html file of your app. It should look something like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<app version="1.0">        
  <name>my_app</name>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <description>My app description</description>
  <content src="index.html"/> 
</app>

- <name> is used as the title of your app in webdoc, after having underscores replaced with spaces and the first letter capitalised.
- <version> must be a floating point number.
- <content> should have a src attribute that is a relative URL pointing to your app's index file.

3. Zip up all the files into one package, including all your CSS and JS.

4. upload the package at http://webdoc.com/admin.



You can also host your app yourself

Follow the instructions above, but at step 2 the <content> src attribute should be an absolute URL to the index file where you app is hosted, and at step 3 your Zip package can contain simply the files config.xml and icon.png.
